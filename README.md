The Adventures of LOC is a short 10 minute game about a college student named LOC who is thrust into an unknown world where he must defeat his greatest mortal enemy.....his sister!

Made in Unity, The Adventures of LOC is a game inspired by the likes of Binding of Issac and Enter the Gungeon. The game features 9 unique enemy types, spans 4 different locations, and has a story that will either cringe or make you chuckle at how ridiculous it is (english was never my best subject).

The game and more infromation including screenshots and trailers are fully avaiable for free on itch.io.

## Disclaimer
This game was never really intended for a large general audience. Initially, this game was made for my friends to play as a joke but I enjoyed creating it so much I decided to continued fleshing it out into what it is now. The game does contain some profanity and explicit language, caution is advised if you are easily offended.
